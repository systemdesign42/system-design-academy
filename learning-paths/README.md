# Learning Paths

Structured paths to master system design, from fundamentals to advanced distributed systems.

## Choose Your Path

| Path | Duration | For |
|------|----------|-----|
| [Beginner](./beginner.md) | 4-6 weeks | New to system design |
| [Intermediate](./intermediate.md) | 6-8 weeks | Ready for real-world patterns |
| [Advanced](./advanced.md) | 8-12 weeks | Targeting senior/staff roles |

## How to Use These Paths

1. **Follow in order** - Each path builds on the previous
2. **Check the boxes** - Track your progress as you complete readings
3. **Do the exercises** - Reading alone isn't enough
4. **Take notes** - Write summaries in your own words
5. **Build projects** - Apply concepts to solidify understanding

## Time Commitment

- **Minimum**: 5-10 hours/week
- **Recommended**: 10-15 hours/week
- **Intensive**: 20+ hours/week

## Assessment

After each path, you should be able to:

### After Beginner
- Explain basic scaling concepts
- Do back-of-envelope calculations
- Design simple systems (URL shortener, pastebin)

### After Intermediate
- Design medium-complexity systems (chat, feed, e-commerce)
- Understand database scaling strategies
- Apply common distributed patterns

### After Advanced
- Design complex systems (payment, streaming, collaboration)
- Make informed architectural tradeoffs
- Read and apply insights from white papers
